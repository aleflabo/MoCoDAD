# Code for visualizing the anomaly scores, the skeletons and the frames
---

> [!WARNING]
> This code has been imported from our project [COSKAD](https://github.com/aleflabo/COSKAD) *"Contracting Skeletal Kinematics for Human-Related Video Anomaly Detection", Flaborea et al., Pattern Recognition Journal, 2024*.
> It has not been tested with MoCoDAD, hence it may not work out of the box. You may use this as a starting point to create your own visualizations.

## Notes on the files

The file `extract_frames.py` provides the code for saving the frames of an MP4 video as .jpg images.

The file `vis.py` provides the code to visualize the anomaly scores, the skeletons and the frames.

The notebook `visualize.ipynb` provides examples and further comments.
